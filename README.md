<!-- TODO: Update the remaining steps if anything changes -->
3. With the server also running [Server API here]("https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-54/rare-v2-api-donkey-kong-api"), check that the login, register, and logout functionality is in working.
4. This template is using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation) for styling. Take a little bit of time to familiarize yourself with the framework if you would like to continue using it.
